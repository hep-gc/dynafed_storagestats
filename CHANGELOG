v0.0.5 Added module import checks.
v0.0.6 StorageStats object class chosen dynamically based on configured plugin.
v0.0.7 Added options
v0.1.0 Changed aws-list to generic and now uses boto3 for generality.
v0.2.0 Added validators key and 'validate_options' function.
v0.2.1 Cleaned up code to PEP8.
v0.2.2 Exception for plugin types not yet implemented.
v0.2.3 Fixed bucket-name issue if not at paths' root and non-standard ports for

v0.2.5 Moved schema validator from function to class method. Added for S3.
v0.2.6 Tested with Minio
v0.2.7 Added files counted to S3 Generic.
v0.2.8 Changed S3 generic API from list_objects_v2 to list_objects as CephS3
       doesn't have the "NextContinuationToken" directive and thus would only
       list the first 1000. This needs to be updated one Ceph has this as
       v1 is sort of deprecated.
v0.2.9 Added ability to specify S3 signature version.
v0.2.10 Added options for memcached, stdoutput and some debugging.
v0.2.11 Fixed issue with ID names with multiple "."
v0.3.0 Added DAV/Http support.

v0.4.3 Added exceptions for configuration file errors, missing options,
       unsupported plugins.
v0.4.4 Added exceptions and error handling for DAV storagestats.
v0.4.5 Changed error to use the exception names. Works better and cleaner.
v0.4.6 ssl_check now uses the ca_path if declared and ssl_check is true.
v0.4.7 Removed the warnings and instead added a status and debug attribute
       to StorageStats objects. Status appends the last ERROR. Debug appends
       all the ones that occur with more detail if available.
v0.4.8 Improved memcached and status/debug output.
v0.4.9 Added starttime and execbeat output.
v0.5.0 Added memcached exceptions, error messages. Added option for execbeat
       output.
v0.6.0 Added quota options and logic to S3 and DAV operations.
v0.6.1 Moved ouptut to object class method.
v0.6.2 Added debug output.
v0.6.3 Renamed storagestats attribute from options to plugin_options.
v0.7.0 Functions don't depend on cli options. Module can be used from the
       interpreter.
v0.7.1 XML StAR files output implemented for S3 and DAV.
v0.7.2 Added generic DAV method to list and obtain used space. Renamed required
       options from quota to storagetats.quota and s3.api to storagestats.api.
v0.7.3 Bug fixes when storagestats.api in DAV was not specified. Cleaned up
       unused parameters in exception classes. Added documentation to all
       exception classes. Cleaned code according to pep8 guidelines.
v0.7.4 Single XML StAR file output with all endpoints' stats.
v0.7.5 Conf files to be processed A->Z
v0.7.6 Fixes multiple white-lines in config files.
v0.7.7 Added logging to files, pwd and WARNING and above.
v0.8.0 Logging module now takes care of creating log messages for file and
       memcached status.
v0.8.1 Added option to specify ouptut logfile.
v0.8.2 Adding INFO and DEBUG file logs
v0.8.3 Added logger definitions to all functions. Added 200 status code check
       and handler for DAV endpoints.
v0.8.4 Global settings mechanism and renamed options to settings, in all vars
       comments and docs.
v0.8.5 Added Azure support. Utilizes azure-storage module's list_blobs function.
       Added the necessary exceptions. Stdout shows filecount, when available.
v0.8.6 Removed schema arguments for debug reporting on S3 schema validation
       which are not used and caused the program to fail.
v0.8.7 Added filecount for S3 ceph-admin api.
v0.8.8 Adds option to specify output directory for storagestats files as
       dynafed_storagestats with its corresponding extension. Adds json file
       output.
v0.8.9 Adds plain txt file output.
v0.8.10 Fixed wrong schema error by having the plugin_settings being validated
        before the schema. Added exception for SchemaIssues. Fixed issue with
        exceptions by adding keywords to the "supr" calls. Added exception
        message to the debug so the --debug output contains the full information.
v0.8.11 Added 'Delimiter': '*' to S3 generic, necessary to iterate AWS buckets.
v0.8.12 Added timeouts to S3 and DAV methods of 5 seconds.
v0.9.0 Added multithreading so that endpoints don't have to wait for others to
        finish. Added function to check Dynafed's connection stats from memcache
        in order to flag endpoints that are offline and skip them from checks.
v0.9.1 Added verbose option to print on sterr logger events.
v0.9.2 Added flexibility to the "check" variable to allow bypassing for invalid
        settings in config files.
v0.9.3 Revamped the exception handling and loggers in order to remove the
        "mlogger" while keeping a consistent format on error reporting and removing
        the necessity to instantiate a second logger. This also facilitates
        flexibility for exception handling so these can be removed from levels
        where it does not belong (before it was used for logging as well and that
        was a bad design.) Removed error message from memcache's status field.
        the error codes should give sufficient information. If more is needed
        the user should either check the logfile or manually run with verbose.
v0.9.4 Updated where in the logic the endpoints' status attribute is given an
        "OK". Also now the memcached index holds multiple errors in a CSV format.
v0.9.5 Added an exception handling when for DAV's RFC4331 obtains zero free
        bytes. While this might be a legitimate empty endpoint, it could also
        be a system that is not configured properly or lacks the ability to
        report this information in which case a manual quota should be input.
v0.9.6 Moved where stats are uploaded to memcached so it is not necessary to
        wait until all endpoints have been polled.
v0.10.0 Dropped support for python2 as it does not have the multiprocessing
         method "starmap" necessary to pass arguments to the function being
         called. Removed deprecated "optsparse" in favour for "argsparse".
         Changed "super" calls to use the python3 format. Corrected formats and
         var names (where makes sense) according to PEP8. Normalized logger
         format.
v0.10.1 Added check to add "/etc/ugr/ugr.conf" file to the list of .conf files
         to parse for settings. Added conn_timeout to validators in StorageStats
         with a default of 10 seconds and this is used as the timeout for
         connections.
v0.10.2 Added second connection try for WebDAV and S3 endpoints (Azure does not
         need it) which tries the standard CA's in case the given ca_path fails.
         If it fails again, then an error is raised.
v0.10.3 Renamed endpoints_tuple to endpoints_args_tuple.
v0.11.0 Added new functions to deal when multiple configured endpoints share the
         same URL, making them actually a unique physical endpoint, to avoid
         multiple queries. Also added the ability to use the "-e flag" to specify
         a single endpoint from the CLI to check.
v0.11.1 Added check if non-api quota setting is setup, to keep the manual number
         if api quota setting, then it is copied from the parent endpoint. Added
         INFO and DEBUG log information for these operations.
v0.12.0 Added error status_codes to all warning/exceptions. Added code error in
         README.
v0.12.1 Changed logger handler from FileHandler to TimedRotatingFileHandler.
         This allows the script to rotate the logfile at midnight, and keeps 15
         days worth.
v0.12.2 Added flag "-c" to work in conjunction with the "-d" flag to allow for
         specific or multiple configuration files and directories.
v0.12.3 Added option to specify an output file, not just a dir. Renamed
         output_dir var to output_path.
v0.12.4 Improved how to deal with empty usage from ceph-admin. Fixed warnings
         and suggestions from pylint.
v1.0.0
  CHANGE: Installable package.
  CHANGE: Added sub-commands to dyanfed-storage executable instead of
          dyanfed_storagestats.
  CHANGE: -c flag now accepts several arguments for file paths instead of
          having to use it several times. -d flag has been removed.
  CHANGE: -o specifies output directory for flags -j, -x and -p.
  CHANGE: Arguments for -j, -x, and -p change the default filename.
v1.0.1
  FIX: Azure list-blob can get full list of blobs on containers with > 5k blobs.
v1.0.2
  CHANGE: Argparse has been moved from runner.py to args.py. Now it works as
          different functions for each of the sub-commands.
  CHANGE: main() in runner.py has been split. Now it selects which sub-command
          function to run depending on the positional argument passed by the
          user. Added stats() and reports() functions.
v1.0.3
  ADDED: For S3, added cloudwatch() function to obtain the following metrics:
         BucketSizeBytes and  NumberOfObjects. These need to be setup in AWS
         before being able to poll.
v1.0.4
  CHANGE: Updated docstrings on all modules (except 'exceptions') to conform with
          PEP257.
v1.0.5
  CHANGE: Python is now chosen via environmental variable instead of path.
  ADDED: Try-except to configloader.parse_conf_files() to deal with bad unicode.
         This will skip the file if there are issues decoding and log a warning.
v1.0.6
  ADDED: __init__.py files to create pypi package.
v1.0.7
  ADDED: Adds support to specify more than one endpoint to check instead of just
         one or all, using the -e flag.
v1.0.8
  CHANGE: Import full path to exceptions modules. Removed 'DSS' from class names.
v1.0.9
  ADDED: python-dateutil requirement.
  ADDED: now_in_utc()
  ADDED: mask_timestamp_by_delta()
  ADDED: '-p', '--delta', '-o' switches to reports sub-command.
  ADDED: S3's list-objects function to output a file list instead of storage
         stats when the 'reports' sub-command is called.
  CHANGE: All time module imports have been changed to datetime module.
  CHANGE: enabled 'reports' sub-command.
v10.0.10
  ADDED: get_file method to AzureStorageShare to generate file list for reports.
  ADDED: storagestats.periodicity option validator.
  CHANGE: Moved time helper functions to time.py file.
v1.0.11
  BUGFIX: DAV storage now properly calculates free space when quota is manually
          set and RFC4331 is used to get stats.
  ADDED: Exception handler and logging when file list report is not supported
         by plugin type using "AttributeError" exception.
v1.0.12
  CHANGE: Renamed 'periodicity' to 'frequency'.
  CHANGE: Moved -v switch to the positional arguments, now it needs to be placed
          after them instead of in-between.
  ADDED: Exception handling when unable to create report files.
v1.0.13
  ADDED: Added storagestats.frequency error code to README.md
v1.0.14
  ADDED: Memcached ttl for data which is a multiple of 10 of the 'frequency'
         setting, and is set to 1 hour as a minimum.
v1.0.15
  ADDED: Added get_object_metadata, get_object_checksum, set_object_metadata
         methods to S3StorageShare.
v1.0.16
  REMOVED: get_object_checksum from s3. This method does not belong here.
v1.0.17
  ADDED: get_cached_storage_stats function.
  ADDED: update_storage_share_storagestats.
  CHANGE: Workflow now tries to obtain storage stats from memcache and update
          objects accordingly. This way we still get the available
          information even if the frequency time has not been surpassed.
v1.0.18
  ADDED: 'checksums' positional command with 'get' and 'put' sub-commands.
  ADDED: base exceptions for checksum error and warnings.
  ADDED: self contained get_object_checksum method for S3StorageShare.
  ADDED: self contained put_object_checksum method for S3StorageShare.
  CHANGE: Renamed set_object_metadata to put_object_metadata.
  REMOVED: validate_checksum and deps, does note belong here.
v1.0.19
  ADDED: '-f, --force' flag to checksums put to force checksum metadata update.
  FIXED: Issue when requesting storagestats with the list-objects API only 1000
         objects would be returned for S3 and Azure classes.
  FIXED: Typo on memcahced missing index log line.
  REMOVED: Redundant memcahce empty checks.
